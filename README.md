Building a Yelp Recommender System

In this project, our team aimed to develop a Yelp recommender system capable of generating ten restaurant recommendations based on either a user or a restaurant input. To achieve this, we constructed a collaborative filtering system using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model with cosine similarity, as well as a content-based filtering system. Additionally, we incorporated Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess the sentiment of written reviews, enhancing the precision of our recommendations.
